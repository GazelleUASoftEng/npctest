Run TestResource.java
change the the web address that pops up to http://localhost:8080/test/product/bylookupcode/*insert lookup code here*
The *insert lookup code here* part should be an actual lookup code from the database.
If you would like to test to make sure that the test resource works change the web address to
http://localhost:8080/test/product/test and you should see the number 4 show up in eclipse.
